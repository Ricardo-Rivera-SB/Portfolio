The goal here was to make a hero page with a very 80's aesthetic, with visuals similar to those people would see at a live show. Using Adobe Premire Pro, I cut together a loop from 80's commercials and movie clips. I also animated the logo and wireframe backgrounds using Photoshop and Adobe After Effects.",
